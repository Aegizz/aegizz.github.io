# Leetcoding Journey

#### Beginnings

My leetcoding journey began as a part of Ravi's Study Program. Ravi's Study Program is a program to help enable students to develop their Software Engineering skills and appeal to companies. The program has a bit of a reputation in the Software Engineering industry in Australia, both good and bad.

RSP had us doing at least 10 leetcodes per week, aiming for a 30% - 50% - 20% split on each difficulty.

Each difficulty also had its own time limit, 10 - 25 - 40 minutes respectively.

This is a graph of my progress:

Here's an overview of the leetcodes I completed.
