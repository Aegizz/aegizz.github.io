<p>RSP is a study programmed aimed at improving coding and software engineering skills with the aim of helping students to land internships and jobs in the top firms.</p>

<p>Whilst software engineering isnâ€™t my goal in life, I still took this program because it teaches valuable skills about time management, self-improvement, work aimed social media and interviewing.</p>
