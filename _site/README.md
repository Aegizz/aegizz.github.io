# Jekyll Github Page

This is the code for my website [Here](https://aegizz.github.io).


Currently the website is running using jekyll & GH pages.

If you want to run this yourself follow the following steps:

```bash

sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev

cd /PATH_TO_REPO/

bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This should run the website on http://127.0.0.1:4000
