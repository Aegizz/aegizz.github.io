## RSP Experience Overview

RSP is a study programmed aimed at improving coding and software engineering skills with the aim of helping students to land internships and jobs in the top firms.

Whilst software engineering isn't my goal in life, I still took this program because it teaches valuable skills about time management, self-improvement, work aimed social media and interviewing.
