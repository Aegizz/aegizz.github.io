# This is the github repo for my website.


Currently the website is running using jekyll & GH pages.

If you want to run this yourself follow the following steps:

```bash

sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev

cd /PATH_TO_REPO/

bundle install


bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This should run the website on localhost:4000
